# GHL Animation Studios Promo Codes and Latest GHL Animation Studios High-Quality Video Deals for 2026

## GHL Animation Studios Introduction

So, you're running a white-label GoHighLevel SaaS business, and you need videos that don't look like they were made on someone's lunch break. Fair enough.

GHL Animation Studios came along because people got tired of hiring random folks from Fiverr who promise the moon but deliver something that looks like it was animated in Microsoft Paint. You know the drill: late deliveries, questionable quality, and that nagging feeling you just threw money into the void.

The folks at GHL Animation Studios actually understand GoHighLevel inside and out. They're not just animators trying to figure out what your CRM does while Googling "what is a pipeline" in another tab. They know the software, they know what features matter to your clients, and they know how to make it look good.

What they offer is pretty straightforward: explainer videos that break down your software's features without making people's eyes glaze over, promotional videos that actually grab attention instead of blending into the scroll, feature animations for specific tools, and those dashboard screenshots that make your interface look professional.

The whole thing is now part of Extendly, which is one of those GoHighLevel ecosystem companies that's been around long enough to know what they're doing. They've got a library of ready-made content that you can customize with your branding. You're not starting from scratch every time.

Here's the thing they get right: they don't make you waste weeks going back and forth. You pick what you want from their library, they slap your logo and colors on it, update the voiceover with your company name, and you're done. It's not revolutionary, but it works.

The quality is legitimately good. These aren't those janky animations where text flies in from seventeen different directions while dubstep plays in the background. They're clean, professional, and they actually help explain what your software does. Which, when you think about it, is the whole point.

## GHL Animation Studios Promo Codes

Here's where things get interesting. As of early 2026, GHL Animation Studios doesn't plaster promo codes all over the place like some businesses do. That's actually kind of refreshing in a weird way.

What they do instead is build savings directly into their pricing structure. Every video on their site shows a regular price crossed out with a lower price next to it. So instead of hunting for codes, you're just getting the discount automatically.

For single videos, the regular price is $595, but they're selling them at $495. That's a $100 discount per video, and it's just... there. No code needed, no expiration drama, no "this code is only valid on Tuesdays when Mercury is in retrograde."

Now, there was a Black Friday deal in 2024 where they offered 25% off with code "BF25". Whether that'll come back in 2026 is anyone's guess, but it's worth keeping an eye out if you're shopping around November.

The bundles are where the real savings kick in. Instead of buying videos one by one, they package them together at prices that make a lot more sense if you need multiple pieces of content.

If you're serious about using their services regularly, signing up for their email list or following their parent company Extendly might get you early access to promotions. They don't spam constantly, which is nice.

### Bundle Packages

| **Bundle Name** | **Regular Price** | **Sale Price** | **What's Included** | **Purchase Link** |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Starter Bundle** | $1,785 | $995 | 3 premium videos (your choice from explainer/ad library), HighLevel Demo Video V1, features animations, branded content, commercial rights | [Buy Now](https://ghlanimationstudios.com?deal=x4maj0) |
| **Professional Bundle** | $4,465 | $1,695 | 6 premium videos (explainer/ad/demo library), 10 feature animations of your choice, full branding customization, commercial rights | [Buy Now](https://ghlanimationstudios.com?deal=x4maj0) |
| **Ultimate Bundle** | $6,745 | $1,995 | 10 premium videos (full library access), all 15 feature animations, complete branding package, commercial rights | [Buy Now](https://ghlanimationstudios.com?deal=x4maj0) |

The explainer videos cover topics like "Replace 15 Softwares," "Conversational AI," "Missed Call Text Back," and "All In One Platform." The ad videos are shorter, punchier pieces for social media or landing pages.

Feature animations include all the key GoHighLevel tools: Workflow Automations, Calendar, Call Recordings, Chat Widget, Contacts & CRM, Email Builder, Social Media Planner, Reporting, and more. You can preview everything on their site before buying, which is smart. Nobody likes buying blind.

What's nice about the bundles is you're not locked into preset combinations. You pick which videos you want from their library. So if you need three explainer videos about specific features your clients care about, you grab those. If you want two explainers and an ad video, cool.

Delivery time isn't instant, but it's reasonable. They'll customize your videos and usually get them back to you within a few business days. All content comes with commercial rights, so you can use it on your website, in ads, on social media, in presentations, wherever.

## GHL Animation Studios Reviews

Reviews for GHL Animation Studios are a mixed bag, which is pretty normal for any service that's been around for a while.

The positive feedback tends to focus on the quality of the animations themselves. People say the videos look professional, the voiceovers are clear and well-done, and the content effectively explains GoHighLevel features. Several users mention that having pre-made content they can quickly customize is a huge time-saver compared to creating videos from scratch or managing freelancers.

The process gets praise too. Browse the library, pick what you want, submit your branding, and wait for delivery. No endless revision cycles or miscommunications about what you're trying to accomplish.

On the flip side, there are some complaints worth noting. The parent company Extendly, which now owns GHL Animation Studios, has gotten criticism for customer service response times. Some users reported waiting weeks for support responses or refunds when they weren't satisfied with their purchase.

A few reviews mentioned that the videos, while good quality, might feel a bit generic since they're template-based. If you're looking for completely custom animations with your specific use cases and examples, this probably isn't the route. These are polished templates you customize with your branding, not bespoke creations.

There's also been feedback about the transition from the original GHL Explainer brand to GHL Animation Studios under Extendly. Some early customers felt the service quality dipped during that transition period, though more recent reviews suggest things have stabilized.

The value proposition seems to resonate with most users. At $495 per video or $1,695 for a six-video bundle, it's cheaper than hiring a video production agency and faster than trying to coordinate with freelancers. For GoHighLevel agencies that need professional-looking content quickly, it hits a sweet spot.

The consensus from the GoHighLevel community seems to be that if you need solid, professional animated videos specifically for explaining and promoting GoHighLevel features, GHL Animation Studios delivers. Just don't expect lightning-fast customer support or completely unique animations.
